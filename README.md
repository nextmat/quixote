Quixote
=======

A simple tool for statefully generating time-series data.

## Installation

In your shell:

    gem install quixote

Then, in your application or script:

    require 'quixote'

## Usage

For each data stream you want to generate, set up a `Quixote` object. Here are some examples:

    percentage = Quixote.new(:min => 0, :max => 100, :varies_by => 10)
    fahrenheit = Quixote.new(:min => -30.0, :max => 120.0, :varies_by => 3.0)
    
An initial value will be randomly generated and can be accessed with `#last`:

	percentage.last #=> 58 
	
If you want to enforce a certain starting value, just set last to whatever you want:

	percentage.last = 60

To get the following values just call `#next`:

    percentage.next #=> 64
    percentage.next #=> 66
	percentage.next #=> 58
	
You can use `#last` to retrieve the most recently generated number or move the range to a number you select at any time.
	
This makes it trivial to generate stateful runs of any length you want:

    values = []
    100.times { values << percentage.next }
    
    values #=> [49, 55, 48, â€¦]
